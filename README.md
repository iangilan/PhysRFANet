# RFA Thermal Effect Prediction Neural Network

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a neural network designed to predict the thermal effects of Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) on liver tumors. RFA is a medical procedure used to ablate, or destroy, liver tumors using heat generated by radiofrequency energy. Understanding the thermal impact of RFA is crucial for effective treatment planning and outcome prediction.

## Features
- 3D Encoder-decoder-based convolutional neural network (EDCNN), U-Net, and Attention U-Net architecture for accurate prediction of ablated area and temperature distribution.
- Custom loss functions that combine MSE, weighted MSE, and dice loss to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Data pre-processing and loading modules for efficient handling of RFA simulation data.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance, including MSE, RMSE, Dice coefficient, and Jaccard index.
