# RFA Thermal Effect Prediction Neural Network

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a neural network designed to predict the thermal effects of Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) on liver tumors. RFA is a medical procedure used to ablate, or destroy, liver tumors using heat generated by radiofrequency energy. Understanding the thermal impact of RFA is crucial for effective treatment planning and outcome prediction.

## Features
- 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for accurate prediction of temperature distribution.
- Custom loss functions to enhance prediction accuracy, including weighted MSE and Dice loss.
- Data pre-processing and loading modules for efficient handling of medical imaging data.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance, including MSE, RMSE, and Dice coefficient.

## Installation
